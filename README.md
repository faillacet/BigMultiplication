# BigMultiplication
Assignment for AlgorithmAnalysis

I think I approached this assignment in a sort of wrong way because it was the only way I could wrap my head around it.
It may not be as efficent as possible, but it does seem to be working.  
Most of the program's code is in the partialprod32 function which i slightly changed from your prototype.
I added a uint32_t return type and a "inherited carry" parameter that is used in a round about way to propogate the carry correctly.
I have been attempting to find ways to circumvent this problem, but I havent been able to think of anything more efficent without completely starting from scratch.
This was a hard assignment, but I learned a lot!
